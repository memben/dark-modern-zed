# Dark Modern for Zed

This tries to be an unopinionated port of Dark Modern Theme to Zed.

Although a great effort I was not fully satisfied with [this approach](https://github.com/kcamcam/vscode_dark_modern.zed).

## Note

This Theme was mainly developed using AI, the initial commit is completely generated, all following commits patch the theme to reach the desired layout.

Default Config was generated via Claude 4 Sonnet, basing generation on [VSCode Theme](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/extensions/theme-defaults/themes), a different flavor of a zed port of [Dark Modern](https://github.com/kcamcam/vscode_dark_modern.zed) and the official [Zed Documentation](https://zed.dev/docs/extensions/themes) [JSON Spec](https://zed.dev/schema/themes/v0.2.0.json)
